		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p> 
		Westlake science &amp; technology private limited was established in 2024 in 
		Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The two founders of the company 
		were teachers from&nbsp; Zhejiang University 
		of Finance and Economics and China Jiliang University. Combining the 
		results of their respective specialties, with an eye on future 
		technologies, the environment, and the needs of society. The company has 
		drawn up a long-term development plan. Starting from&nbsp; data processing business 
		and innovation platform development that the company obtains income from scientific research, 
		we gradually accumulate the company's intellectual property rights and prospect technology.
After peer review, the company's business will be divided into 7 stages, the first stage of technology accumulation, 
the second stage for equipment installation, the third stage for GIS information services, the fourth stage for GIS 
oil and mining data business, the fifth stage is smart community, the sixth stage is 
		three dimension innovation video creation&nbsp; system.
Below is the company's product evolution route.

		<h5>Smart Community Construction wtih VR&AI technology</h5>
		Building an intelligent community, especially by utilizing GIS 
		(Geographic Information Systems), big data, virtual reality (VR), and 
		third-generation network technologies, can significantly enhance the 
		quality of life in the community and provide personalized services. Here 
		are some steps and considerations to achieve this goal:<br>
		<br>
		1.Planning Phase<br>
		2. GIS Applications<br>		
		3. Big Data Processing<br>
		4. Virtual Reality (VR) Applications<br>
		5. Third-Generation Network Technologies<br>
		6. Implementation and Management<br>
		7. Global Perspective<br>
	By following these steps, it is possible to build a comprehensive and 
		high-quality intelligent community that meets the needs of Canadian 
		residents and serves as a reference for global residents.

		1. Tool Overview<br>
		This tool aims to convert a limited number of images and text 
		descriptions into 3D short videos. It is suitable for creating virtual 
		tours, product demonstrations, educational content, and more.<br>
		2. Inputs and Requirements<br>
		3. Key Components of the Tool<br>
		4. Example Tools<br>
		5. Future Outlook<br>
		As technology advances, more AI and automation tools can simplify the 
		process, such as AI-generated 3D models and automated video editing. 
		Additionally, the integration of augmented reality (AR) and virtual 
		reality (VR) technologies will further enhance the immersion and 
		interactivity of 3D short videos.<br>
		By combining these steps and technologies, you can create a powerful and 
		efficient tool for generating 3D short videos, utilizing a few images 
		and text descriptions to provide users with a vivid visual experience.</div>
